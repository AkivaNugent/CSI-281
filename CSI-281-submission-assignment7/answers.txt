1. 3 real world examples of a queue are:
			1. A line of people
			2. A piping bag
			3. lotion bottles (the ones with the pump that extends to the bottom)

2. 3 real world examples of a stack are:
			1. Plane boarding
			2. Physically stacked objects like a pile of books or boxes
			3. The plates on a barbell

3. Not necessarily. Unit tests -like theyre namesake, only test a small part of the code in isolation. The code may
	still fail because of the interaction between 'units' or unexpected inputs that the unit tests
	didnt account for.

4. Linked lists are preferable because of their ability to dynamically change the size of the list and
	their ability to pop items off the front without shifting everything in the list. A fixed size would
	require that you do high cost opperations whenever you want to pop or push an item.
