1. randomIntArray() is going to be O(N) because it simply goes one by one for the length of the Array
	and adds a random number. There are no nested loops or recursion.

2.If the array is unsorted, the time complexity is O(N) because it needs to check each item down the line,
	If the Array is sorted already, the itme complexity is O(logN) because it continually divides the
	array in half, which is the opposite of exponents i.e. logarithmically.

3. Linear search    : 5 instructions x 10,000 items = 50,000 instructions per search
   Sorting Algorithm: 12 * 10,000 elements * log2(10,000) = 1,594,526 instructions (flat)
   Bianary Search   : 10 * log(10,000) = 133 instructions per search;

   Finding meeting point : 50,000x = 133x + 1,594,526
						 : 49,867x = 1,594,526
						 :       x = 31.97

   Bianary search must do 32 searches to pass the efficiency of a linear search given the initial cost
   of the sorting algorithm.

4. 1. A sturcture contianing to integers
   2. A vector/array of 2
   3. A tuple
