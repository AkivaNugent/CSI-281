1. While all of these algorithms have the same time complexity, bubble sort swaps items much more than the
   other two algorthims, making it more costly to work down the array on each of its n^2 loops.

2. In the best cases (entirely sorted) insertion sort only needs to compare each item 1 time,
   giving it a time complexity of O(n). Selection sort always makes n^2 comparisons, regardless of the
   array's closeness to being sorted.

3. There needs to be something to compare for being less or more, meaning there must be some
   opperation overloading (at a minimum the "<" or ">" opperator). 

4. std::sort is faster because it uses a more efficient sorting algorithm, one that has a time complexity
   closer to O(nlogn). Additionally, since it is the default sort theres likely many more optimizations
   that go beyond the scope of what we've learned so far (things like early exits and efficient memory storage).
   The largest factor is the time complexity of the sorting algorithm though.
