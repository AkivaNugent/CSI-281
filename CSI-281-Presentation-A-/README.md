# Simple A* (A-Star) for CSI-281. 

### TODO
- [ ] Ill write comments in this doc, explaining the code. Didn't want to comment too much in the actual source files because of clutter during presenting
	- [ ] I'm not sure what's obvious or not since I wrote all of it and it makes sense 'to me', so if there's anything that needs to be explained write it at the bottom of this doc and I'll make a note to write down what it does.

- [ ] Most of the main.cpp stuff. Tests are really basic and don't really test much.
  - [ ] maybe writing a function to generate a 100 x 100 graph and randomly add in walls might be a good idea.
- [ ] I might have fucked up the actual building part of VS, so if it doesn't work on your machines tell me and ill try to fix it :)
