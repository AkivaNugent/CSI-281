1. It depends - BGF will go level by level down the graph which will give you the shortest path between the nodes, but DFS could MYABE get to a 
	result faster by virtue of digging deeper faster and happening to pick a decent path.

2. The O(n) of BFS is O(V + E) because it checks every single vertecies as well as all edges at most one time.

3. An adjacency list only requires the amount of space for the existing vertecies and edges, so if the network of people does not have a high degree of
	overlap in friends, the space doesnt need to grow exponentially, but only with the actual connections.

4. When you go on a walk. When walking from the campus to the lake side, even if you ndont know the way exactly, you typically dont sweep every street 
	as you make your way down. You instead make your way down deep then change course if you hit a deadend or branching path.
